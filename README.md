## Introduction
### An Apple Watch app that *currently* detects pushups

### Requirements
1. Apple Watch(with watchos 2)
2. Xcode 7(and higher. Preferably 7.3)
3. Iphone (supported by xcode 7 and above)

### Installation
1. Download repo
2. Open Vague.xcworkspace
3. Build and run the watch app

### Notes
1. The watch app displays the pushup reps
2. The iphone app displays the counter changes from the watch app. It does not work as a standalone app.
2. The empty field labeled crunches will not update (it is currently defunct)

### Known bugs
1. The rep counter works fine when the app is first opened after running the product but tends to double count when the app is opened multiple times in one run.
2. The rep counter only works if you do the pushup according to the guy in this video which is "the right way" of doing a pushup (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE7tMeIlXiU)
